  <p><em>2020-12-03 21:04:08</em></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is anyone in engineering ed teaching slow growth/human-scale growth/“against exponential growth” models for technology? Would love to see a syllabus. My students hear anecdotal stories but need economic models in more sustained form.</p>&mdash; ablerism (@ablerism) <a href="https://twitter.com/ablerism/status/1334136306054598665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>This timely and useful prompt by <a href="https://twitter.com/ablerism">@ablerism</a> points to a devasting gap in current engineering pedagogy.</p>
<p>In the last few years, climate activism, especially among youth, has achieved an unprecedented urgency.  Critiques of our current economic system and its reliance on exponential growth are now commonplace; there are widespread calls for the fossil fuel industry to be dismantled immediately.</p>
<p>But if we hope to inhabit a future without fossil fuels, and live within a flourishing economy that respects planetary boundaries, we must complement our critique with a positive, guiding vision and agenda.  We must collectively design alternative, sustainable approaches to food systems, water infrastrucutre, housing, energy, communications -- everything, at every scale.</p>
<p>We can't accomplish any of that, at the scale and scope and with the global level of coordination that is required to mitigate disaster, without concrete plans for action.  We can't develop concrete plans for action without the sort of systematic, quantitative analyses and designs that we associate with sophisticated engineering projects.  And this engineering analysis and design -- massive in scope and dire in its urgency -- needs to be done by someone.  Conveying this need, framing and motivating the relevant problem statements, and pointing at useful entry points into the landscape of possible solutions should be, I think, a core focus of our engineering pedgogy.</p>
<p>This necessary engineering pedagogy will, however, be empty, pointless -- and will fail its students -- if it is not accompanied by socio-economic analyses that offer some explanation for the origins of our current predicament, as well as by promising alternative economic models that offer some hope of a different, better path forward. Without an economic critique, and without being presented with any positive alternatives, students will certainly resign themselves to the idea that 'there is no alternative', and go on to reproduce the system as it has been.  If we allow this to happen, they -- and we -- will suffer; it is a certainty that the system as it has been -- one that demands exponential economic growth -- cannot continue, whether or not we adapt or change our ways.  To avoid this truth in our teaching, and attempt to remain agnostic with respect to the economics that our students will practice, is not just to fail them, but also to abandon our own hopes for a not-terrible future.</p>
<p>What follows is a hodge-podge collection of media, authors, and movements that seem to me to provide useful guidance or provocation on the subject of 'growth', its consequences, and some alternatives.  It certainly misses many important references (I'll hope to include more as I learn more); it attempts to lean towards accessible approaches to the subject that would appeal to engineering students with a pragmatic orientation.</p>

<h2>Small Farm Future</h2>
<p>So much to say on this work.  Absolute favorite of the moment.</p>

<p>“Making the case for a society built around local economies, self provisioning, agricultural diversity and a shared Earth.”</p>

</ul>
<p>Smaje has a lovely dialectical style.  The book begins with a review of ten 'crises' that lead Smaje to argue that our best chance for a flourishing future involves many more people on small farms growing food for self-provisioning. He provides concrete guidance as to how we might achieve such a vision, including the transformation in cultural roles that would need to take place.  Fascinating, generative work.</p>

<h2>Walkaway</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Doctorow_novel)">Novel</a> by Cory Doctorow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Set in our near-future, it is a story of walking away from &quot;non-work&quot;, and surveillance and control by a brutal, immensely rich oligarchical elite; love and romance; a post-scarcity gift economy; revolution and eventual war; and a means of finally ending death.&quot;</p>

<h2>Solarpunk</h2>
<p>Solarpunk was initially a sci-fi genre; there are now many folks who consider themselves to be 'solarpunks'.  Solarpunk tends to try to be as optimistic as possible about possible visions ecologically sustainable, decentralized future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;By now, dystopia may have become a luxury genre. Indulging in miserable future scenarios is not something everyone has time for. William Gibson recently repurposed his own adage, “the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed” to say that “dystopia is not very evenly distributed” either.2 For most, the dystopias the privileged entertain themselves with are old news. In the current political landscape, “when we are all living in the shadow of at least half a dozen wildly science fiction scenarios,” to quote Gibson again, and while Hollywood harps on every version of paranoia to construct a thousand dystopias according to formula, dwelling on dystopia could be seen as downright lazy.3 Along with the resources to sit around and ponder the future of humanity, shouldn’t there come the responsibility to invent actionable proposals as opposed to cautionary tales?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It’s hard out here for futurists under 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As we percolated through our respective nations’ education systems, we were exposed to WorldChanging and TED talks, to artfully-designed green consumerism and sustainable development NGOs. Yet we also grew up with doomsday predictions slated to hit before our expected retirement ages, with the slow but inexorable militarization of metropolitan police departments, with the failure of the existing political order to deal with the existential-but-not-yet-urgent threat of climate change. Many of us feel it’s unethical to bring children into a world like ours. We have grown up under a shadow, and if we sometimes resemble fungus it should be taken as a credit to our adaptability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The &quot;solar&quot; in Solarpunk is both a description and metaphor for the movement's commitment to a utopia that is accessible to every human on earth, as well as to all of our planet's lifeforms. No single business can capture and privatize sunlight to hoard it for itself or sell it at a cost. It's one of the only universally accessible goods. Solarpunk futures envision a world of distributed clean energy, available and benefiting everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The re-distribution of power, whether it's political or electric, is at the heart of my story,&quot; Solarpunk author, Alia Gee, tells Hopes&amp;Fears. 'Getting the power aspect taken care of is the only way I believe there can be a better future for everyone. (I'm very keen on the everyone part. Not just white males or CIS or human-like life forms.)'&quot;</p>

<h2>Tim Jackson</h2>
<p>Jackson, an economist, was commissioned by the UK government to write a report on the future of the British economy, which he expanded into a book. The book argues that the current global economy relies on exponential growth, that this is unsustainable in terms of material and energy resources, and that we must therefore seek 'non-growth' economic models.</p>

<h2>Four Futures</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/12/four-futures">Four Futures: Essay</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In 'Four Futures', Peter Frase assumes that the rise of automation will necessarily undermine capitalism, and lays out a 'quadrant' analysis of possible post-capitalist futures that might result. The two axes are &quot;authoritarian vs. non-authoritarian&quot; and &quot;scarcity vs. abundance&quot;. Of particular note are two quadrants: &quot;non-authoritarian + abundance&quot; -- the 'Star Trek' future, in which everyone can meet their needs in decentralized manner; and &quot;authoritarian + abundance&quot; -- the 'Anti- Star Trek' future, in which high technology is under centralized, corporate governance.</p>
