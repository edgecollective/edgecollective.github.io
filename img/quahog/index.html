<h1>The Quahog: an electronic multitool for the farm</h1>

<p>Our friends at the farm tech cooperative <a href="">Edge Collective</a> have spent the last year refining the <a href="">Quahog</a> -- a rugged, versatile 'electronic multi-tool' for measuring and controlling valuable assets on the farm.  (An early version of the Quahog has been posting temperature, humidity, and solar battery data to <a href="">FarmOS</a> from a <a href="">farm in Maine</a>  about every two minutes since November 2018!) Edge Collective is beginning to sell hand-assembled Quahog prototypes to early adopters who need this sort of solution on their farm, and the existing codebase for the Quahog already makes it easy to post to FarmOS.</p>
<p>Initial applications of the Quahog have mostly focused on remote greenhouse and freezer temperature monitoring; but, because the device is open source, adding new functionality is really just a matter of developing (or finding) relevant code (in Arduino or Micropython). Edge Collective recently developed a Quahog hardware and software interface for <a href="">Decagon / Meter soil moisture sensors</a>, and they're hoping to connect with light sensors, relays, and motor controllers soon.</p>
<p>The Quahog is particularly flexible around communications and power: out of the box, it can use WiFi, or simple point-to-point <a href="">LoRa radio</a> with a range of a few kilometers. It can also be used to connect via cellular modem or satellite modem for truly remote off-grid farming applications.  The Quahog's beefy voltage regulator can handle up to 36 Volts, so you can hook it up to a car battery if need be -- and it comes with an external timer that allows it to operate on very low power.  (For electronics geeks:  connections for serial, i2c, and SPI protocols are all available, as well as an easy interface to MicroSD cards for datalogging or sensor configuration.  The Quahog is based on the popular <a href="">Espressif ESP32</a> microcontroller).</p>
<p><a href="">Edge Collective</a> is particularly excited to work with famers who have gnarly, &quot;edge case&quot; problems that haven't been addressed by available off-the-shelf hardware. They're contracting with farms to retrofit existing proprietary hardware with open source data and control backends.  If that interests you -- or if you'd like to buy an assembled <a href="">Quahog</a> device, help to contribute code, or build a Quahog yourself -- you can contact Edge Collective <a href="">here</a>.</p>
